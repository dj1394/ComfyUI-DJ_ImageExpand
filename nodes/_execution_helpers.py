"""Fail-soft seams onto ComfyUI's execution loop, shared by the pack's nodes.

The decode and encode loops run on a worker thread (asyncio.to_thread), which
copies the caller's context variables - the same ones ComfyUI reads to
attribute an interrupt or a progress update to the node being executed - so
these seams work unchanged from there. Every ComfyUI import is deferred and
optional, so offline tests and older cores simply run the loops
uninstrumented. The pack's once-per-process console notes and its choice of
compute device live here too, so no helper module keeps its own copy.
