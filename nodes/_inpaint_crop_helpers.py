"""Crop-for-inpaint geometry and stitching shared by DJ ImageExpand nodes.

The contract is a two-rect canvas:

* ``canvas`` is the original image, edge-replicate padded only when the
  grown context rect truly cannot fit inside the frame.
* ``canvas_to_original`` locates the untouched original inside the canvas.
* ``crop_to_canvas`` locates the crop handed to the sampler inside the
  canvas.

Stitching blends the (possibly resized) inpainted crop into the canvas
with a feathered blend mask, then slices ``canvas_to_original`` back out.
Because the original pixels sit verbatim in the canvas and the blend is
applied as ``canvas + blend * (inpainted - canvas)`` with a hard zero
guard, every pixel outside the blend region is bit-identical to the
input image — nothing outside the crop ever round-trips a resize. The
optional edge-halo spread only swaps the color that gets blended in, so
that guarantee holds with the toggle on as well.

The "blend in" seam (the section near the end) hands an outpaint over by
depth into the picture instead of by the blend mask; its promise is the
same for every pixel deeper than its ramps.

    adds flat pixels of context on top of the ``context_factor`` growth.
    An empty mask selects the full image without context growth, so the

    ``target_megapixels`` rescales the crop for the sampler so its area is

    counts grow the frame itself before anything else — the new bands are
    replicate-filled, added to the mask, and become part of the stitched

    broadcasts across an N-frame inpainted batch, and a stitcher built
    from more frames than came back is trimmed to the leading ``N``
    (video models return 8n+1 or 4n+1 frames and drop the tail).

    ``fix_edge_halo`` swaps the blended-in color for the spread foreground
    color from :func:`spread_edge_colors`; it never widens the blend, so
    the zero-weight guarantee is unaffected. Identity round trips are only
    exact with the toggle off, since the spread deliberately rewrites the

    ``color_match`` (0..1) shifts the patch's tone by the offset measured
    in the feathered band (:func:`estimate_tone_offset`) before blending,
    so an outpaint whose new bands came out a touch lighter or warmer than
    the picture lands on the picture's own tone. 0 leaves the patch alone.

    ``seam`` "classic" is everything above. "blend in" replaces it on a

    read where the model redrew the picture, and only used when it holds
    on a held-out part of that strip); at 0 blend in leaves the model's
    colour as painted. ``fix_edge_halo`` does not apply. A Crop For Inpaint
