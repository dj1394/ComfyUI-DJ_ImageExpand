// frontend versions: detail.exec_info.queue_remaining and
// detail.status.exec_info.queue_remaining. Anything else (including the null
// detail sent on disconnect) resolves to null, which callers must ignore
// rather than treat as "queue empty".

// of an "executed" event; strings are accepted too, and anything else is
// ignored so a malformed payload never breaks the status stream.
