// Which workflow tab a run belongs to.
//
// Every workflow tab in one browser page shares one connection to the
// server, and ComfyUI files a node's results by its node id. A run queued in
// one tab that finishes while another tab is open therefore lands on the
// node with the same id in the open tab: its preview, and its onExecuted
// call. Core only shows the stray picture; an DJ ImageExpand node that keeps what a
// run sent (Show Text's text, the Seed history) would also save it into the
// wrong workflow.
//
// This module remembers which graph queued each run and says whether the
// run reporting now belongs to the graph on screen. js/prompt_scope wires it
// to the api; the nodes ask isForeignRun() before they take a result. No DOM
// and no ComfyUI imports, so node:test covers it.
