//
//   if (w.computeSize)            -> fixed height, kept OUT of the split

// this pack derived that fixed height from the node's WIDTH, which is why
// dragging a node taller only added dead space underneath: the panel had
// already been given a height and excluded from the leftover-space split.
//
// The frontend mounts a DOM widget's element inside a frame: DomWidgets.vue
// insets it by `options.margin` per side (default 10), so the element gets
// 20 fewer CSS pixels of height than the layout hands the widget. Any floor
// meant to guarantee room for fixed-height content must add this allowance,
// or the panel's bottom edge renders clipped flat - which is how the LoRA

// panel declaring 320 cannot be dragged under 424, and a node that opened
// at 340 jumps to 444 the moment its corner is touched. This measures that
// padding from the frontend itself instead of copying its constants: a
