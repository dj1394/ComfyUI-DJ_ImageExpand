// preview from the frontend automatically: an image one as the canvas widget
// named $$canvas-image-preview, a video one as the DOM widget named
// video-preview. Every DJ ImageExpand node here already presents that same result
// inside its own panel, so left alone the node shows it twice, once in the
// panel and once again underneath.
//
// The widgets are hidden rather than removed. The frontend re-adds a preview
// whenever it finds none and the node has images, so removing one just brings
// it back on the next frame; a hidden widget is still found by name and left
// alone. Its value is untouched either way, and neither serializes.
